This project was made to send automatic texts to my grandpa everyday to give him quotes to think on, to feel less lonely, and to be tricked into thinking that I wake up early everyday.

Made with Textbelt SMS API - Allows one text a day by default. No need to put in your own number or email, just the number of the person
you want to text. Place their number in a separate file where phone = their phone number. Make sure to place that file in .gitignore

Pip install requests. Other modules should come with python, but may depend on your version.
